This is a straightforward WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor that I developed early in my JavaScript journey. The project allows users to easily customize text and see a live preview that closely mirrors the final output as they type. It provides a simple, intuitive way to format and style content without needing to write raw HTML, making it accessible for users who want a visual representation of their work in real time. This project is a foundational experience in learning how to build interactive, user-friendly interfaces
